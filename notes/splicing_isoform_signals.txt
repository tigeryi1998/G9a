Interpreting Splicing or Isoform-Level Signals
=============================================

What is "splicing" or "isoform-level signals"?
----------------------------------------------
Genes like EHMT2 (G9a) can produce multiple isoforms (alternative versions of mRNA) through:
- Alternative transcription start sites (e.g., long vs short first exon, or FE)
- Alternative splicing (e.g., inclusion or exclusion of exon 10)

So even if total gene expression stays constant, specific isoforms can shift dramatically,
and those can be biologically important — as in your case.

What does it mean in your data?
-------------------------------
In your knockout design:

| Condition | Design                                   | Expected Splicing Effect                     |
|----------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| KO1      | Short FE, + Exon 10                      | High expression of cancer-promoting isoform  |
| KO2      | Short FE, – Exon 10                      | Loss of cancer isoform (some suppression)    |
| KO3      | Long FE, + Exon 10                       | Highest isoform promoting cancer             |
| KO4      | Long FE, – Exon 10                       | Partial suppression                          |
| WT+M     | Morpholino blocks Exon 10                | Suppressed cancer isoform                    |

So:
- Gene-level DE (what you're seeing now) might show big fold changes.
- But it’s possible that isoform-level or exon-level analysis would give even richer resolution 
  (e.g., confirming exon 10 is skipped in WT+M).

How to explore isoform/splicing signals?
----------------------------------------

1. Transcript-level quantification tools
----------------------------------------
Instead of raw gene counts, use pseudoaligners to estimate isoform-level expression:

- Salmon or kallisto
  - They quantify individual isoforms (transcripts)
  - Input: FASTQ files + reference transcriptome (e.g., GENCODE .fa + .gtf)
- Then use tximport to bring this into DESeq2 or limma

2. Exon-level or junction-level analysis
----------------------------------------
Use tools like:
- DEXSeq: Detects differential exon usage (splicing)
- rMATS: Focuses on splicing events (e.g., skipped exon, retained intron)
- MAJIQ / SUPPA: Model local splicing variations

These will tell you:
- Is exon 10 really skipped in WT+M?
- Is long FE used more in KO3 than KO2?

3. Visualization
----------------
- Use IGV to visualize BAMs + GTF and visually see exon 10 being skipped
- Use Sashimi plots (from ggsashimi or rmats2sashimi) to view junction reads
- plotCounts(dds, gene = "ENSG00000204371.12", intgroup = "condition") shows gene-level signal,
  but exon-level views can uncover more

Takeaway
--------
Right now you’ve shown gene-level DE, which already shows big fold changes. But:
- If your hypothesis is about exon 10 or FE inclusion, then splicing analysis can directly confirm it.
- Especially useful to validate what each KO line is actually doing at the isoform level.


Let me know if you’d like a step-by-step to do:

Salmon quantification,

DEXSeq setup, or

Sashimi plots for visual splicing validation.
