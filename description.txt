Sample | Description                      | First Exon (FE) | Exon 10  | Expected G9a (EHMT2) Expression               
-------|----------------------------------|------------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------
KO     | Knockout (mixed isoforms)        | Mixed            | Mixed    | Moderate – heterogeneous expression           
KO1    | Knockout, short FE, + E10        | Short            | Included | High – long isoform lost, but still some G9a  
KO2    | Knockout, short FE, – E10        | Short            | Skipped  | Medium – further loss of isoform              
KO3    | Knockout, long FE, + E10         | Long             | Included | Highest – mimics cancer-promoting isoform     
KO4    | Knockout, long FE, – E10         | Long             | Skipped  | High/moderate - Partial suppression                                 
WT     | Wild type                        | Mixed            | Mixed    | Low baseline                                  
WT+M   | Morpholino-treated (E10 skipped) | Likely Short     | Skipped  | Lowest - suppression of cancer isoform
